# React Native - The Practical Guide [2024]

This README file captures my day-by-day learning journey in the React Native course. Each day, I’ll update my outline with key topics, resources used, personal notes, and reflections on what I learned.

Now, I am going to add my Day 01 learning. Moving forward, I will continue updating this file with the topics I cover each day, reflecting on what I’ve learned.


## Day-01, 06 November

 - `Introduction` to React Native and its `architecture`
 - `Created a new React Native project`, set up the development environment, and `run the first app on a android simulator`.
