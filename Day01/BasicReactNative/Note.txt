6. style obejct can be applied on only: View & text 
7. style can't be inharit from parent to child in native.
8. There are some styling difference between ios & android. Like , Border radius on Text is not works for Ios. We  need to give it on View.
9. We can use useState like React to store info.
10. We can use Event handler like React. 
11. Event Handler ==> onPress, onChangeText
12. In react native, it doesn't scroll auto. That why we have to use==> ScrollView
13. ScrollView vs Flatlist ==> Flatlist render a large array of data in a optimized way. 
14. Use of Flatlist
    ==> Pass the array in the data prop
    ==> render the data through renderItems props
    ==> need key must
    ==> can use keyExtractor if my object doesn't carry any key property
    ==> It takes Key property auto as Key value
